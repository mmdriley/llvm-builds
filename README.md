# LLVM builds

Pushing to `main` will kick off builds of https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
on Windows, macOS, and Linux from the commit in [`llvm-commit.txt`](./llvm-commit.txt).

Build options are listed in [`BuildSettings.txt`](./BuildSettings.txt).

The built copies of LLVM are attached to a new
[release](https://github.com/mmdriley/llvm-builds/releases).
